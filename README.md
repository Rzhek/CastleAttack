# Castle Attack Project

This project was created during my Game & Sim Programming class.

It refers to the <a href="https://www.masterycoding.com/">MasteryCoding</a> video guides and uses its sprites and animations.

The projects represents a multy-level game where the player controls the cannon and has a goal to shoot the castle to drop the crown. The assessment of player's performance is calculated based on the number of balls the player used. The result is displayed at the end of each level with stars (from 1 to 3)

</br>

The project has a potential to scale by adding more levels, textures of cannons, castles, crowns, and surrounding objects

<i>The final level with stone mountains and lava was lost and will be possibly recovered in the future</i>
